## About the Video Course
In this course, you'll learn how to build your own calculator web app from the ground up with just HTML5, CSS, and Javascript in less than an hour.
You'll learn:
How to create the HTML5 structures of an app. 
How to make an app pretty with CSS (design, design, design!) 
How to make an app work (solve problems) with logic, i.e Javascript 
By the end of the course, you'll be one stop closer to creating web apps like a pro. You could even try creating other smaller web apps.
The course is structured in such a way that each section will handle one of the 3 languages covered here. 
Introduction: This is where we explain how the app works, and what we'll be using to achieve the same results. 
Module 1: This Module shows how to create the bare bones of the app with HTML5. The result will be a page with all the elements we need in our app, devoid any colors or design elements. 
Module 2: Here, we'll "beautify" our app. We'll be using CSS elements to give our app colors and styles. At the end of this module, we'll have a calculator app that looks like the final result, albeit one that does not perform any calculations yet. 
Module 3: This would be the meat of the course. We'll be delving into Javascript in this module, and I'll teach you how to make the app work (perform calculations and display the results) in here. 
Final section: Finally, we will give you some ideas on how to improve the app and make it your own in terms of design and functionalities.
